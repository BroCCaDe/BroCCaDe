Project Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the project is to extend an open source Intrusion Detection
 System (IDS) to detect network-based covert channels.
 At the moment there are a lot of academic literatures for proposed techniques
 to do covert channels and how to detect them, but there is no integrated
 approach to detect covert channel yet.
 This is due to the vast possibilities of covert channel which means that
 it is not feasible to address each covert channel separately (huge overhead).
 The project is then proposed to bridge this gap between academic and public
 space by exploring the idea of a flexible and extensible framework inside
 an IDS and provide a proof of concept implementation to show the framework's
 usability.
 In addition, we will also explore the idea of generalizing covert channel
 techniques based on patterns which further boosts the flexibility.

\begin_layout Section
Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IDS is a security mechanism in which the priority is to be able to detect
 intrusions and deal with them accordingly.
 Generally, IDS is categorized as Network IDS (NIDS) or Host IDS (HIDS)
 which differs from each other in terms of the focus of the system.
 HIDS is primarily dealing with the intrusion against host system, e.g.
 file integrity, while NIDS is primarily dealing with intrusion in the network
 traffic.
 To some degree, HIDS may be more powerful than NIDS as HIDS reporting is
 more comprehensive than NIDS (it also detect anomaly in the resulting activity).
 Even though HIDS may monitor network traffic like NIDS, but there are several
 reason why we focus our attention to NIDS instead of HIDS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HIDS may be more easily compromised as host security can depends on end
 user using/maintaining the host vs NIDS runs on machine managed by professional
 staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are now more and more low-power/low-performance devices like smart
 phones and all sorts of embedded devices (TVs, CCTV cameras, DVRs etc.)
 which may not be able to run a HIDS, so a NIDS has to be used to protect
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are quite a number of operating systems, which means for the implementatio
n we would either have to focus on a particular subset OS or spend extra
 time on porting code 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Covert channel may happen in a communication to and from the host, but not
 involving the host itself, e.g.
 the case where the covert channel sender / recipient is the immediate node
 from the host.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following we compare some of the NIDS tools that are widely used.
 For a more comprehensive comparison between the tools, the reader is referred

Snort

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Snort is one of the most popular open source NIDS which has been there since
 1998.
 It works by sniffing the packet from the network, decode the packet, and
 then take action based on the rules specified.
 Snort is extensible in a sense that people can contribute to the rules
 easily.
 However, adding new mechanism to analyze network traffic is not so straightforw
ard.
 If we want to add covert channel detection, then we have to incorporate
 the detection mechanism into the core of Snort and recompile the whole
 package (patches).
 Snort is still actively developed, with Snort 3.0 underway

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suricata is the direct competitor of Snort.
 It is a relatively new NIDS compared to Snort, works in a similar way to
 Snort (focusing on the rule matching), with the difference that Suricata
 is multi-threaded, as opposed to Snort that is currently single-threaded
 (Snort developers are planning for the multi-threaded version

).
 There is a more detailed comparison between Snort and Suricata in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Since it is similar to Snort, it is also not that easy to extend the NIDS
 with covert channel detection mechanism.
 Suricata is still actively developed

Bro

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bro is another open source NIDS that takes on different angle than Snort
 and Suricata.
 As opposed to matching packets against rules, it passively observe what
 is happening in the network and reports whatever it sees.
 Although Bro also works as an IDS, it does so by adding the detection /
 analyze plugin based on the network traffic report.
 With this infrastructure, the task of extending Bro is then a matter of
 creating another analyze plugin which will be based on the covert channel
 detection technique we implemented and the events generated by Bro.
 Bro is still actively developed

\end_inset

, and the mailing list also has recent activities

\end_inset

.
 Initially, Bro is developed as an academic tools, so prior to version 2.0
 the usability is quite low.
 However, since version 2.0, Bro switches gear and hired dedicated software
 engineers to bridge the gap between academic use and operational use

Comparison and Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below I propose a summary of the features comparison between Snort, Suricata,
 and Bro.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Type of IDS describes the detection mechanism of the IDS.
 Snort and Suricata matches traffic against signature / rules, and then
 report the event should there be a violation of policy.
 Bro, on the other hand, works by analyzing the events reported.
 Depending on the detection plugin, it can be anomaly based or rule based
 (Bro has a signature framework), or even based upon statistical analysis
 of the events.
 This make Bro a flexible tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extensibility describes what involves in extending the IDS with a new covert
 channel detection mechanism.
 Since Snort and Suricata already have a fixed detection mechanism, to incorpora
te a new detection mechanism it means we have to add a new mechanism to
 the core IDS.
 To be more precise, Snort also has a mechanism to add new detection plugin
 but it is limited to add new keywords for the rule matching and which part
 of the packet to inspect.
 For Bro, we just need to add a new plugin which makes use of the events
 reported to determine whether there is a covert channel in the communication.
 Note that at this moment we are relying on the reporting mechanism in Bro,
 so if Bro doesn't have the events that we are interested, then it also
 involves adding new events to report in Bro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Capacity per instance describes the suggested bandwith that can be handled
 by each instance of the NIDS.
 Even though Bro has lower bandwith than Snort and Suricata, but in a common
 4-cores CPU Bro can reach a reasonable bandwith of 1 Gbps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scalability describes whether the IDS is easily deployed to handle big network
 traffic.
 Snort is going for multi-threaded version in Snort 3.0 , but the released
 version 2.9 is still a single-threaded program.
 Suricata has been a multi-threaded program so it is easier to scale and
 making use of multi core CPU compared to Snort (although it doesn't necessarily
 mean Suricata is more superior).
 Bro is in itself a single threaded program.
 Nevertheless, Bro can be designed as a cluster of Bros that can communicate
 with other instance of Bro.
 This feature of Bro makes it scalable even when the implementation of covert
 channel detection is computationally heavy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User base indicates that Snort is the most popular and widely used NIDS
 at the moment.
 That said, both Suricata and Bro also have their own user base in their
 respective conferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Active development describes whether there is a recent development and /
 or mailing list activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All of the NIDS use free license.

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the comparison, Snort and Suricata do not really align with our
 project's goal as they already have a fixed set of detection mechanism
 (rules matching) while we want to add a mechanism to detect covert channel
 (which may not necessarily be a rules matching).
 In contrast, Bro mainly deals with reporting events and the detection mechanism
 is built on top of these comprehensive reporting, which we may also tweak
 to include a mechanism to detect covert channel.
 Bro also has reasonable bandwith, and decent user base.
 Therefore, I propose that we use Bro as the open source target IDS that
 we extend.
