V0.1.

This plugin extracts the URG_flag and URG_ptr from each incoming TCP packet.

Contained in this folder is the source code and the script. In order to compile the 
plugin, just ``configure'' and ``make'' the plugin from the plugin root directory. The 
prerequisites to build the plugin is to have the Bro source code and have satisfied Bro 
prerequisites to compile. In the plugin root directory, we just need to type

    ./configure --bro-dist=<bro-dist>
    make

to configure and build the plugin where ``<bro-dist>'' is the downloaded Bro source code. 
The result of this is a directory called ``build'' 
which contains all of the required files for Bro to recognize that it is a plugin. So the
next step is then to make Bro to actually recognize the plugin. There are two ways to do 
this, either we point Bro to the directory containing the build files, or we can copy the 
build files to a directory where Bro will search for available plugins. Where <bro> is 
the location for the installed Bro, the default location where Bro searches for plugins 
will be in

    <bro>/lib/bro/plugins

where ``<bro>'' is the directory where Bro is installed on the system. So from the 
plugin root directory, we can type

    cp -r build/. <bro>/lib/bro/plugins/<plugin-directory-name>

where <plugin-directory-name> is an arbitrary directory name used to distinguish the 
plugin, or alternatively set the environment

    export BRO_PLUGIN_PATH=<plugin-root-directory>/build

where <plugin-root-directory> is the plugin folder.

*****************************************************************************************

This plugin is different from the other feature extraction plugins where in that attaches 
itself to BRO analyzer tree which is applied to every incoming packet. If the packet is 
a TCP packet, then the plugin will raise

    FeatureExtraction::URG_feature_event(UID : string, id : conn_id, 
        dir : FeatureAnalysis::Direction, URG_flag : count, URG_ptr : count) 

which can be analyzed by the analysis plugin. ``UID'' is the unique Bro identifier, 
``id'' is the 5-tuple connection id consisting of source and destination IP address, 
protocol, source and destination port, ``dir'' is the direction (forward or backward with
respect to the flow), ``URG_flag'' and ``URG_ptr'' are fields of TCP segment indicating
the urgent flag and urgent pointer respectively.
