This work was supported by a grant from the Comcast Innovation Fund.

This plugin prints the normal data for Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and equiprobable bins used
in determining the histogram (entropy and multimodal analysis) and CCE.

Contained in this folder is the source code and the script. In order to compile the 
plugin, just ``configure'' and ``make'' the plugin from the plugin root directory. The 
prerequisites to build the plugin is to have the Bro source code and have satisfied Bro 
prerequisites to compile. In the plugin root directory, we just need to type

    ./configure --bro-dist=<Bro-dist>
    make

to configure and build the plugin. The result of this is a directory called ``build'' 
which contains all of the required files for Bro to recognize that it is a plugin. So the
next step is then to make Bro to actually recognize the plugin. There are two ways to do 
this, either we point Bro to the directory containing the build files, or we can copy the 
build files to a directory where Bro will search for available plugins. Where <Bro> is 
the location for the installed Bro, the default location where Bro searches for plugins 
will be in

    <Bro>/lib/bro/plugins

so from the plugin root directory, we can type

    cp -r build/. <Bro>/lib/bro/plugins/<plugin-directory-name>

or alternatively set the environment

    export BRO_PLUGIN_PATH=<plugin-root-directory>/build

There is already a script which hooks into inter arrival time event. If there is a need
to extend the traning of KS data and equiprobable bins, then just add the handler to that
particular event.
