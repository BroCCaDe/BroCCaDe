This work was supported by a grant from the Comcast Innovation Fund.

This plugin prints the metrics calculated from the analysis plugin out to a file. The 
file is in the arff format to be used as an input to Weka.

Contained in this folder is the source code and the script. In order to compile the 
plugin, just ``configure'' and ``make'' the plugin from the plugin root directory. The 
prerequisites to build the plugin is to have the Bro source code and have satisfied Bro 
prerequisites to compile. In the plugin root directory, we just need to type

    ./configure --bro-dist=<Bro-dist>
    make

to configure and build the plugin. The result of this is a directory called ``build'' 
which contains all of the required files for Bro to recognize that it is a plugin. So the
next step is then to make Bro to actually recognize the plugin. There are two ways to do 
this, either we point Bro to the directory containing the build files, or we can copy the 
build files to a directory where Bro will search for available plugins. Where <Bro> is 
the location for the installed Bro, the default location where Bro searches for plugins 
will be in

    <Bro>/lib/bro/plugins

so from the plugin root directory, we can type

    cp -r build/. <Bro>/lib/bro/plugins/<plugin-directory-name>

or alternatively set the environment

    export BRO_PLUGIN_PATH=<plugin-root-directory>/build

On the analysis script which handles the metric for training, we pass on the information
to the this plugin. Each analysis set is distinguished by its ID. Each training data will
need to specify:
    * Relation name : specified by calling FeatureTraining::ChangeRelation
    * Attributes    : added by calling FeatureTraining::AddAttributes
    * Class names   : these are a special attribute and is assumed to be always present.
        They are appended to the training data by calling FeatureTraining::AddClass
    * Data          : each data row is appended to the training data by calling
        FeatureTraining::AddDataRow

The training data can be printed to a file anytime by calling 
    FeatureTraining::print_training_data.
