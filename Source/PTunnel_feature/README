V 0.1

This plugin extracts the first 4 bytes of the ICMP payload.

Contained in this folder is the source code and the script. In order to compile the 
plugin, just ``configure'' and ``make'' the plugin from the plugin root directory. The 
prerequisites to build the plugin is to have the Bro source code and have satisfied Bro 
prerequisites to compile. In the plugin root directory, we just need to type

    ./configure --bro-dist=<bro-dist>
    make

to configure and build the plugin where ``<bro-dist>'' is the downloaded Bro source code. 
The result of this is a directory called ``build'' 
which contains all of the required files for Bro to recognize that it is a plugin. So the
next step is then to make Bro to actually recognize the plugin. There are two ways to do 
this, either we point Bro to the directory containing the build files, or we can copy the 
build files to a directory where Bro will search for available plugins. Where <bro> is 
the location for the installed Bro, the default location where Bro searches for plugins 
will be in

    <bro>/lib/bro/plugins

where ``<bro>'' is the directory where Bro is installed on the system. So from the 
plugin root directory, we can type

    cp -r build/. <bro>/lib/bro/plugins/<plugin-directory-name>

, where <plugin-directory-name> is an arbitrary directory name used to distinguish the 
plugin, or alternatively set the environment

    export BRO_PLUGIN_PATH=<plugin-root-directory>/build

where <plugin-root-directory> is the plugin folder.

In the analysis script, we need to extract the first 4 bytes of the ICMP payload (both
request and reply) by calling the function

    FeatureExtraction::ExtractHeaderFeature(UID : string, id : conn_id, dir : 
        FeatureAnalysis::Direction, payload : string, position : count, len : count)

where ``UID'' is the unique BRO identifier, ``id'' is the 5-tuple connection id consist-
ing of source and destination IP address, protocol, source and destination port, ``dir''
is the direction (forward or backward with respect to the flow), ``payload'' is the ICMP
payload, ``position'' is the starting position of data in the payload to be extracted, and
``len'' indicates how many bytes to extract the data. To deal with ping tunnel problem,
extract the first 4 bytes of the ICMP payload by setting the position=0 and len=4, and 
then the plugin will raise

    FeatureExtraction::PTunnel_feature_event(UID : string, id : conn_id, 
        dir : FeatureAnalysis::Direction, payload : double)

which can be handled by the analysis plugin to analyze the first 4 bytes of the ICMP
payload.
