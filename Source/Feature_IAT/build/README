*****************************************************************************************

This work was supported by a grant from the Comcast Innovation Fund.

This plugin extracts the inter arrival time from each incoming packet of a flow. Each 
flow is distinguished by a unique identifier that Bro attaches to each flow / connection.

Contained in this folder is the source code and the script. In order to compile the 
plugin, just ``configure'' and ``make'' the plugin from the plugin root directory. The 
prerequisites to build the plugin is to have the Bro source code and have satisfied Bro 
prerequisites to compile. In the plugin root directory, we just need to type

    ./configure --bro-dist=<Bro-dist>
    make

to configure and build the plugin. The result of this is a directory called ``build'' 
which contains all of the required files for Bro to recognize that it is a plugin. So the
next step is then to make Bro to actually recognize the plugin. There are two ways to do 
this, either we point Bro to the directory containing the build files, or we can copy the 
build files to a directory where Bro will search for available plugins. Where <Bro> is 
the location for the installed Bro, the default location where Bro searches for plugins 
will be in

    <Bro>/lib/bro/plugins

so from the plugin root directory, we can type

    cp -r build/. <Bro>/lib/bro/plugins/<plugin-directory-name>

or alternatively set the environment

    export BRO_PLUGIN_PATH=<plugin-root-directory>/build

Currently the script is calculating inter arrival time for each incoming packet. If 
the flow of interest is already identified, the number of flows can be reduced 
considerably by using targeted script instead of extracting the feature of all of the 
incoming packets.

In the analysis script, need to handle this event:

    IAT::feature_event(UID:string, id:conn_id, value: double)
